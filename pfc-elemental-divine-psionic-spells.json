The user can study one aura per round and determine one aspect of that aura of the user's choice. If the rate is studied the user can determine the rate of the creature rounded to the nearest multiple of 10.

The GM tells the psion the approximate percentage chance of success if the party were to follow that course of action completely and not deviate from it. The psion reads this information from the likelihood of different possible futures.

If the target is completely blind this ability will not help it see, but works against partial blindness. The target cannot be surprised by someone sneaking up behind them unless they are hiding behind cover. The target can also search areas much more efficiently since they can see more at once. This ability does not grant any dice off vision checks normally, but the GM may rule that it has extra effects in certain situations."

No matter how far they go from the casting point they will always know exactly what direction it is and how far, even if they teleport or are blindfolded as they travel. As long as this power is in effect, that location is considered memlocked for the user. This will not guarantee that the user knows the exact path back to where they started, like in a maze for example. However at each turn or junction the user can attempt an attribute check of four dice against INT to tell which path is the correct one to take them back toward their starting point. If the user moves to another plane during the duration and there is an open portal between their current plane and the plane they cast this on, they will be able to know the direction and distance to that portal. If no portal exists that directly links both planes, they will only be able to tell they are on a different plane."

This lets the user reroll one of the rolls that they just made and choose which roll to use. This ability cannot be used multiple times on the same roll.

It will not allow the user to predict other creature's actions before they happen, but they can react to those actions better. The user gets one die off of all checks (attribute, resistance, and skill) they make while using this ability. They also get +4 to all their defense values and +2 to their attack and damage rolls.

The user learns the individual\u2019s real name, the name they go by, a mental image of the individual and their current location, the individual's rate, and their background. The mental image is good enough to count as a memlock for the user and will last as long as a normal memlock before fading.

Instantaneous spells that affect the group will not go away at the end of this duration, like Fireball, healing spells, or teleportation. However spells with durations that have not expired when this duration ends will stop affecting the other creatures even though they continue to affect the user. Note that for area of effect spells, the other creatures could be affected by it twice if both the user and a target are in the area. Spells that require an additional cost to be paid in the process of or after the casting of the spell, such as instantaneous rateburners and Mutate effects, must be paid by all creatures in the group.

Any mental attacks against the user will only affect one of the parts determined randomly. If one part is incapacitated or controlled in some manner, the other part can automatically choose to assume control of the body and the afflicted part can only use purely mental abilities.

Within the area, spells can\u2019t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. The Anti-Magic Zone does not move with the caster.Spells and other magical effects, except those created by a deity or their artifacts, are suppressed in the zone and can\u2019t protrude into it. Units or charges expended to cast a suppressed spell are consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn\u2019t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.Targeted Effects: Spells and other magical effects, such as Minibolt, that target a creature or an object in the zone have no effect on that target.Areas of Magic: The area of another spell or magical effect, such as Fireball, can't extend into the area. If the Anti-Magic Zone overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the zone is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a Flame Barrier are suppressed within the zone, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.Spells: Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the zone is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.Magic Items: The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the zone. For example, a +1 Long Sword in the Sphere functions as a nonmagical Long Sword. A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the zone or wielded by an attacker in the zone. If a magic weapon or piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the zone (For example, if someone fires a +1 bullet or throws a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.Magical Travel: Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the zone, whether the zone is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space, temporarily closes while in the zone.Creatures and Objects: A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the zone. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the zone.Revocation Magic: Spells and magical effects such as Revocation have no effect on the zone. Likewise, the spheres created by different Anti-Magic Area spells don't nullify each other."
